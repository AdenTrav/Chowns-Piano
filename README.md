# Background About Recording Process
All piano note samples were recorded on David Chown's 1947 Steinway B, with many of the original parts still existing within the piano, including the original Steinway logo. 
The impulse response that is used for the convolution reverb (controlled by the room slider) was recorded in Fine Arts 115 on Northwestern Michigan Colleges Campus. The impulse was recorded using a balloon pop and a C414, as well as a Zoom H6 field recorder. 
Chown's Piano was recorded using two AKG C414s, and all the piano note samples were played/recorded by Aden Travis. The virtual instrument was made, and produced, by Aden Travis using HISE (https://hise.dev/).

# Installation Instructions

# UPDATE:
I have been made aware recently that Logic Pro only supports its native **AU** format for plugins, as a result you **CANNOT** install the plugin for Logic Pro (as of right now). I do not own a Mac device, and therefore cannot export the plugin in the native **Audio Unit** format. I would like to eventually add Logic Pro compatability, but cannot as of right now. I'm sorry to all my Logic users.
